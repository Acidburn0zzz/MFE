The CoCo folder was created to include in it the modules required for the version of 
the tools for the Confluence Competition (CoCo) 2016. We finally decided to modify 
other modules in the MFE environment, and decided going for an independent git branch. 
If interested in recovering any of the developments for it, switch to the coco branch.
