        <h2>Hello MFE!</h2>
        <p> Once the MFE is installed in your favourite platform, it is time to start using it with a very
            simple example. As it has been pointed out in the <a href="/installation">installation</a> section,
            although all the tools come with the MFE, you only need to worry about those you are interested in.

            In this section we illlustrate the use of the CRC and MTT tools.
            The CRC is completely implemented in Maude, and therefore can
            be executed on its official distribution.
            However, the MTT requires the version of Maude extended with hooks
            and appropriate back-end tool for the termination proofs.
            Please, follow the instruction in the <a href="installation">installation</a> section.
            You can still try the example below, appropriate messages will be provided
            when the termination proofs are attempted.
        </p>
        <p> We assume that MFE.zip file was unzipped in your home directory.
            If you have done it somewhere else, please, change the paths below.
        </p>
        <p> Let us use the following command to execute Maude and load the MFE:

        </p>

        The first thing you need to keep in mind is that the MFE is built on Full Maude,
        and that all commands entered to the MFE must go between parentheses. Modules
        may be entered either with or without them, but you must be familiar with the way to
        do it.
        If you are not familiar with the use of Full Maude, perhaps you should give a
        quick read to Sections <a href="http://maude.lcc.uma.es/manual271/maude-manualch15.html#x80-23800015.1">5.1</a>
        and <a href="http://maude.lcc.uma.es/manual271/maude-manualch15.html#x80-23900015.2">5.2</a> of the
        Maude manual to have a basic idea of how using Maude modules into Full Maude, or what happens if you
        enter a command without parentheses to Full Maude. If you don't want to read it yet, don't worry, just
        make sure that all modules and commands you enter go between parentheses.

        Any of the tools in the environment can be used on any module loaded either in Maude
        or in Full Maude. To simplify things, and following our own advice, we will use parentheses
        everywhere.

        Let us consider the following specification of the natural numbers with constructors <code>0</code>
        and <code>s</code> and commutative operations <code>_+_</code> and <code>_*_</code>.

        <pre class="maude"
            ng-bind-html="processCode(
'Maude> (set include BOOL off .)
set include BOOL off

Maude> (set include TRUTH-VALUE on .)
set include TRUTH-VALUE on

Maude> (fmod MYNAT is
          sort MyNat .
          op 0 : -> MyNat [ctor] .
          op s : MyNat -> MyNat [ctor] .

          op _+_ : MyNat MyNat -> MyNat [comm] .
          op _*_ : MyNat MyNat -> MyNat [comm] .

          vars N M : MyNat .
          eq 0 + N = N .
          eq s(N) + M = s(N + M) .

          eq 0 * N = 0 .
          eq s(N) * M = M + (N * M) .
        endfm)')">
</pre>

<p>
Note that both Maude and Full Maude automatically include in every module the <i>predefined</i>
<code>BOOL</code> module. Since built-ins cannot be handled by the CRC and most of the other
tools in the MFE, we use the <code>set include BOOL off</code> command before entering the module.
If you need the booleans, the usual things to do is including <code>TRUTH-VALUE</code>, where
the sort <code>Bool</code> and constants <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are defined,
but avoiding built-in operations such as <code>_==_</code> and <code>_=/=_</code>.
<p>

  <p>
      To simplify the interaction with the different tools, we select the tool we are
      interested in and enter commands for it. If we want to deal with pending proof
      obligations in other tools we just need to select it. We can move from one tool
      to another, and MFE will keep the state of the interaction with each of the tools
      for us. Check the commands on the <a href="/installation">howtouse</a> section
      for getting the current state of the tools or asking for a list of available commands.
  </p>

  <h4>MTT set up.</h4>
  <p>
  We will complete a proof of the Church-Rosser property of the above specification.
  To get it, we will use the CRC tool for checking local confluence and sort-decreasingness,
  and the MTT for the termination proof.
  Since tools can submit proof obligations to corresponding tools in the environment,
  we can carry on our proof in the CRC.
  However, since the MTT will be internally used, we need to set it up, and
  specifically, indicate which is the external tool to be used (the name given in the mfe.config file).
  </p>

  <p>
  We can do this just by selecting the MTT tool and the external tool for it.
  </p>
  <pre>
Maude> (select tool MTT .)
The MTT has been set as current tool.

Maude> (select external tool aprove .)
aprove is now the current external tool.
  </pre>

        <h4>Check of the Church-Rosser property with the CRC.</h4>
        <p>
            To select the CRC we type the following command.
        </p>
        <pre>
Maude> (select tool CRC .)
The CRC has been set as current tool.
        </pre>
        <p>
        To run the Church-Rosser check on the above module <code>MYNAT</code>,
        we may enter the following command.
        </p>
        <pre>
Maude> (ccr MYNAT .)

Church-Rosser check for MYNAT
<span class="maude-info">The following critical pairs must be proved joinable:
  cp</span> MYNAT4
    s(N:MyNat +(#2:MyNat +(N:MyNat * #2:MyNat)))
    = s(#2:MyNat +(N:MyNat +(N:MyNat * #2:MyNat))).
	The module is sort-decreasing.
       </pre>

       <p>
       First, note that most commands are available in an abbreviated form.
       In this case we could have used either <code>ccr</code> or <code>check Church-Rosser</code>.
       Check the help of the tool for a list of available commands and their
       short versions.
       </p>
       <p>
       The tool gives as result the critical pairs that could not join, if any,
       and the a set of membership obligations for sort-decreasingness. In this case,
       one critical pair is given, and since no memberships are given the tool
       says the module is sort-decreasing.
       For a detailed description of the use of the CRC tool and guidelines on how to
       interpret the proof obligations returned, we recommend to the interested
       reader to take a look to at the
       <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567832611001147">JLAMP
       paper by Dur√°n and Meseguer</a>.
       </p>
       <p>
       In this case we can see that the second equation for the multiplication is too
       general, and if we change it for
       <code class="maude maude-inline" ng-bind-html="processCode('eq s(N) * s(M) = s(M) + (N * s(M)) .')"></code>
       the test succeeds.
       Note that the critical pair might also be due to <code>_+_</code> not being
       associative. We could try to modify the specification and see what happens.
       Notice that the specification may be ground Church-Rosser already,
       and that it does not require any modification.

<pre>
Maude> (fmod MYNAT is
          sort MyNat .
          op 0 : -> MyNat [ctor] .
          op s : MyNat -> MyNat [ctor] .

          op _+_ : MyNat MyNat -> MyNat [comm assoc] .
          op _*_ : MyNat MyNat -> MyNat [comm] .

          vars N M : MyNat .
          eq 0 + N = N .
          eq s(N) + M = s(N + M) .

          eq 0 * N = 0 .
          eq s(N) * M = M + (N * M) .
        endfm)
Advisory: Module MYNAT redefined.
Introduced module MYNAT
</pre>

<p>
We can now request a new check.
</p>

<pre>
Maude> (check Church-Rosser .)
The CRC for MYNAT has been reset.
Church-Rosser check for MYNAT
  All critical pairs have been joined.
  The specification is locally-confluent.
  The module is sort-decreasing.
</pre>

<p>
Since there are no unjoinable critical pairs, the tool can conclude that the
specification is locally confluent.
We can now attempt completing the proof by submitting the pending proof obligation.
By using the <code>submit</code> command, the CRC will request the termination
proof to the MTT.
</p>

<pre>
Maude> (submit .)
The termination goal for the functional part of MYNAT has been submitted to MTT.
Success: The functional part of module MYNAT is terminating.
The functional part of module MYNAT has been checked terminating.
Success: The module is therefore Church-Rosser.
Success: The module MYNAT is Church-Rosser.
</pre>

<p>
Since the MTT was able to check the termination of the <code>MNAT</code> module,
the proof of the confluence, and therefore the of Church-Rosser property, is
completed.
