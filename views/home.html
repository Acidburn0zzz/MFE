        <h1>Maude Formal Environment</h1>

        <p>
            The <i>Maude Formal Environment</i> (MFE) is an executable and highly extensible software infrastructure
            within which a user can interact with several tools to mechanically verify properties of
            <a href="http://maude.cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Maude</a>
            specifications. In MFE, tools can interoperate to discharge proof obligations of different nature
            without
            switching between different tool environments. The integration of different tools inside MFE's common
            environment presents the user with a consistent user interface, a mechanism to keep track of pending
            proof obligations, and allows the execution of several instances of each tool, among other features.
