    <h1>Maude Formal Environment</h1>

    <p>
        The <i>Maude Formal Environment</i> (MFE) is an executable and highly extensible software infrastructure
        within which a user can interact with several tools to verify properties of
        <a href="http://maude.cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Maude</a>
        specifications. In MFE, tools can interoperate to discharge proof obligations of different nature
        without switching between different tool environments. The integration of different tools inside MFE's
        common environment presents the user with a consistent user interface, a mechanism to keep track of pending
        proof obligations, and allows the execution of several instances of each tool, among other features.
    </p>
    <p>
      MFE is modeled in Maude as an object-based system in which the tools are objects and their communication 
      mechanism is message passing. User interaction is available through
      <a href="https://github.com/maude-team/full-maude" target="_blank">Full Maude</a>, an extension
      of Maude that has become a common base on top of which tools can be built, offering a modular design
      for easily integrating other tools written in Maude.
