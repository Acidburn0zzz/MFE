    <h2>Maude++</h2>
    <p>
      For tools which depend on external utilities not directly available in the
      official distribution of Maude, such as <i>MTT</i> and <i>SCC</i>, we have
      extended the official version with built-in operators associated with
      appropriate C++ code that interacts with the external tools. This extension
      of Maude, called <i>Maude++</i> is available only for Linux and OS X architectures.
      The OS X version does not include support for SCC, since it relies on the CETA library,
      which is only available for Linux platforms.
      <br>
      The MFE can also be executed in the official distribution of Maude, but
      without support for the decision procedures implemented for the aforementioned tools.
